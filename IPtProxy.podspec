  s.description      = <<-DESC
    Both Lyrebird/Obfs4proxy and Snowflake Pluggable Transports are written in Go, which
    is a little annoying to use on iOS and Android.
    This project encapsulates all the machinations to make it work and provides an
    easy to install binary including a wrapper around both.

    Problems solved in particular are:

    - One cannot compile `main` packages with `gomobile`. Both PTs are patched
      to avoid this.
    - Both PTs are gathered under one roof here, since you cannot have two
      `gomobile` frameworks as dependencies, since there are some common Go
      runtime functions exported, which will create a name clash.
    - Environment variable changes during runtime will not be recognized by
      `goptlib` when done from within Swift/Objective-C. Therefore, sensible
      values are hardcoded in the Go wrapper.
    - The ports where the PTs will listen on are hardcoded, since communicating
      the used ports back to the app would be quite some work (e.g. trying to
      read it from STDOUT) for very little benefit.
    - Snowflake and Lyrebird/Obfs4proxy are patched to accept all configuration parameters
      directly.

    Contained transport versions:

    | Transport | Version |
    |-----------|--------:|
    | Lyrebird  |   0.6.0 |
    | Snowflake |  2.11.0 |
